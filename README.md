Quizgame assessment

finished question 1

almost finished question 2.
    - on issue with question 2 input checkmarks defaulting checked.  should be simple to fix.
    - UPDATE (found out that this was due to me using the same uniq key when iterating through the options in questions 1 and 2.  Easy fix by just changing the key, HOWEVER, since I realized this only after my time was up, I have not fixed it..)

didnt get to question 3 yet.
